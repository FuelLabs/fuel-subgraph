  # By default we disable Brew publishing because it's assumed that most owner
  # of this repository will not have the a Homebrew tap repository created which
  # fails the release.
  #
  # To enable Brew publishing, create an empty repository `<owner>/homebrew-tap`
  # which will hold the Homebrew formula.
  #
  # If you would like to use a different name than `homebrew-tap`, you can define
  # brew-tap-repo: <name> below this.
  #
  # Once available, you can enable the Brew publishing by removing the `brew-disabled`
  # line.
