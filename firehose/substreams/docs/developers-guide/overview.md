# Overview

## Developer's guide overview

The Substreams Developer's guide explains the process of building a Substreams module responsible for tracking the ERC721 holder count for an Ethereum smart contract.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Tip**_:_ The Substreams Developer's guide is focused on an Ethereum Substreams module. The development tasks and workflow are independent of the blockchain selected for your project.
{% endhint %}

Example Substreams modules for Solana, Aptos, and other chains are available for reference and study. [Find a full list on the examples page](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/reference-and-specs/examples) of the Substreams documentation.

Read through the [fundamentals](../concepts-and-fundamentals/fundamentals.md) to get a good grasp of what Substreams is first.

StreamingFast and the Substreams community have provided an assortment of different examples that you can use to explore and learn more.

#### Substreams template for Developer's guide

The accompanying template for the Developer's guide is[ ](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-template)conveniently located in the [official Substreams Template Github repository](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-template).

#### Substreams for Solana

A basic [Substreams module for the Solana blockchain](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-solana-quickstart) demonstrates how to reference the chain-specific SPKG, endpoints, and data models.
