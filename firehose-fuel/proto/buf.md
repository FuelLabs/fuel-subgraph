### StreamingFast Firehose Fuel Types

Protobuf definitions when dealing with Firehose Fuel chain(s).

Foremost, this provides [sf.fuel.types.v1.Block](https://buf.build/FuelLabs/firehose-fuel/docs/main:sf.fuel.type.v1#sf.fuel.type.v1.Block) which is used for consuming Firehose & Substreams fuel block model.

This is probably the only model you should really care about, the rest are meant for internal communications for Firehose operators.
